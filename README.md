# MVP - Minimum Viable Phoenix

This app is an extremely basic Phoenix app for teaching how to nicely deploy Phoenix apps.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Deployment

This app is deployed via [edeliver](https://github.com/edeliver/edeliver).
